# Whack-a-Trump
This is a game I coded for my AP Computer Science final project in 2016. The game creates a grid of holes where different political candidates from the 2016 election pop up, and the user, who has selected a political affiliation beforehand, must "whack" the candidates from the opposing party. As the name implies, it's like Whack-a-Mole, but for political candidates. 

I coded it over the span of a few weeks by myself in junior year of high school before I had really learned programming, so much of the documentation is severely lacking and some of the coding style / efficiency is perhaps what you might expect from a high school junior. 

Part of the project was to create a video trailer for the game showing its functionality, and that can trailer can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IKQbTTabBK97y7CaaTgR0dPclZ6bDYCz/view?usp=sharing
